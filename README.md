# TD-SkinChanger
Tactical Duty.io Skin Changer

### **Installation**
***
* Go to **Releases** tab
* Download the newest version
* Unzip with for example WinRAR
* Run **TD SkinChanger.exe**

### **Commands**
***
* /SKINS - all skins in the game and their IDs
* /KNIVES - all knives in the game and their IDs
* /SKIN - change your skin
* /KNIFE - change your knife
* /CURRENT - your currently equipped skins
* /HELP - commands list

### **Important Notes**
***
* You **do not** need to use upper case for commands
* **cosmetics.json** file might be **out of date** when the game updates and in that case you're going to have to use your own imagination and brain to find new skin IDs. I suggest you do that by dumping game's assets with something like **Assets Studio** and then looking at file names.
* You **cannot change your skin mid-game**, it will update when you enter a new game
* **You can get banned for using this** but don't worry, it's not very likely because TD has no anticheat. I will not be taking responsibiliy for lost accounts.
* Tactical Duty uses IP bans
* **As far as I'm concerned**, this works server-side so everybody should be able to see your skin
* I currently do not have a full list of knives names, but if you do, please **contact me on discord or through an issue**
