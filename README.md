# TD-SkinChanger
Tactical Duty.io Skin Changer

## **Installation**
* Go to **Releases** tab
* Download the newest version
* Unzip with for example WinRAR
* Run **TD SkinChanger.exe**

## **Usage**
### Setting skins
First, we use **/SET** to trigger the command that will change the skin for us. We'll be asked to choose the slot, just type it in. For a list of slots, use **/SLOTS**. The last step is to type in the id of the skin we want.
### Getting skin IDs
Run **/IDS**. Then type in the slot you want an IDs list for. (knife, AK, etc.)
### What are slots?
Slots are basically just elements of your TD locker. So for example outfit or a knife. For a full list of slots supported by this Skin Changer, simple run **/SLOTS**.
### Other commands
**/CURRENT** - Sends your current TD locker.
**/HELP** - Sends this guide.
**/EXIT** - Kills the process. Click Ctrl+C to cancel.
**/CLEAR** - Clears the terminal up.
**/ALIAS** - List of command abbreviations.
**/ABBREVIATIONS** - List of slots abbreviations.
### Shorter Forms
Commands **/SET** and **/IDS** can be run as one step commands instead of 2/3 step commands, examples:
```
/SET OUTFIT 43
/IDS KNIFE
```
These of course can be used with alias/abbreviations, examples:
```
/S OTF 37
/ID AK
```

## **Important Notes**
* You **do not** need to use upper case for commands
* You **do not** need to suffix commands with a slash
* **cosmetics.json** file might be **out of date** when the game updates and in that case you're going to have to use your own imagination and brain to find new skin IDs. I suggest you do that by dumping game's assets with something like **Assets Studio** and then looking at file names
